# PADS
PADS is a general purpose programming language designed to automate tasks, 
and run complex scripts in a format that only involves a few flags, and options. 
The first flag in the syntax is made to access logic from modules which may have their own complex logic. 
The second flag in the syntax is made to access options that may be available in those modules. 
PADS also has robust error checking; so you can be sure not to enter the wrong flags.
