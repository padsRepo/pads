# Welcome to "I’m Just Gonna Write This Down"

Because every time I Google that one command, I get a different Stack Overflow thread, a random Reddit post from 2014, and some guy’s blog that ends in "just figure it out lol." No thanks.

This site is my brain’s external hard drive — a growing pile of tutorials, cheat sheets, and “why the hell didn’t I write this down last time?” moments. It’s not here to rank on Google. It’s here so I don’t scream into the void every time I need to remember how to fix a broken Python venv or properly rsync with flags I always forget.

If it helps you too, awesome. If not... I didn’t build it for you anyway.
